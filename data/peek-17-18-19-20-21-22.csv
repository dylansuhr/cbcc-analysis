Hi Joe-

We have created your reservation for a private charter aboard the historic MARIE L! 

#**Here is a summary of your itinerary:**

**3:00pm**--Depart from the Portland Public Water Taxi Dock in Portland’s Old Port at **72 Commercial St, Portland, Maine.**

Once aboard, relax with your friends and family and enjoy our selection of local beers, imported wines, and other drinks as we cruise past some of Portland's best coastal sights.  We'll stop in a calm, scenic spot for an intimate, on-board wedding ceremony, officiated by your Captain.

There'll be time for some celebration and enjoyment of any food or cake you'd like to bring aboard.  We'll keep the drinks flowing as we continue to cruise Casco Bay, **returning to Portland around 6pm**.

This is a private charter so only your group will be on board along with a captain and deckhand.


#**Additional Information**

The cost for this charter is $115/person plus applicable taxes).  This rate includes all drinks (champagne, wine, beer, spiked seltzers, and non-alcoholic drinks) and also includes the services of your Captain as officiant.  **A $300 deposit is due within 7 days to secure your reservation**, with balance due prior to your charter departure.
